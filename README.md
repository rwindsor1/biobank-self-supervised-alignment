# biobank-self-supervised-alignment

This repository contains code for the experiments detailed in 'Self-Supervised Multi-Modal Alignment For Whole Body Medical Imaging' (see arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06652)). 
This uses data from the UK Biobank ([register here](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/register)). For details on downloading and preprocessing the UK Biobank, please view [this repository](https://github.com/rwindsor1/UKBiobankDXAMRIPreprocessing).

You are welcome to use this code either to reproduce the results of our experiments or for your own research. 
However, if you do, please cite the following:
